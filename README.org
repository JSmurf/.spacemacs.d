* Spacemacs Configuration
This is my configuration for Spacemacs. This is where I will store all of the changes that I make, and (hopefully) make things easier to carry over when I get a new computer. 

** Installation

- Installing Spacemacs is (relatively) simple. 

- Follow the instructions from [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][The Spacemacs GitHub]].

- Clone this repo, and delete `~/.spacemacs` to make sure Spacemacs gets all of these configurations.

- Install ispell by running src_sh{brew install ispell}
